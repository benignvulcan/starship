Super-Terse Compiling/Installing Instructions

Requirements:
  A reasonable modern desktop/laptop computer.
    benignvulcan is currently developing this game on a four year old
      2.4 GHz Core2 Duo P9400 with 4 GB RAM
      under Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit
  Python 2.6 or 2.7
  Qt libraries, versions 4.6, 4.7, or 4.8
    It might work just fine with Qt 5 when PyQt5 becomes available.
  PyQt4 libraries + pyuic4
    Must match your version of Python
  Build environment is currently minimal, but does assume a *NIX environment,
    notably 'make'.
  Development is using `git` version management software.

Under Debian/Ubuntu systems:
  apt-get install python-qt4 pyqt4-dev-tools git
  git checkout https://github.com/benignvulcan/starship
  cd starship; ./run    # builds _ui.py files and executes app
