Dwarf Fortress notes (fortress mode)
  user does not directly control dwarves!
  various methods of management, with very poorly factored UI:
    map-based inspectors:
      k general tile contents
      v unit-specific details
          including labor restrictions
      t contents of buildings
    map-based controls:
      d designate areas: mining, gathering, en mass item properties, traffic
      p define stockpiles: a single rectangular area - stockpiles pull items in
      i define zones: a single rectangular area
      b build discrete sized stationary things: furniture, doors, windows, building, traps, leveers
      q stationary item config: workshop tasks, building prefs & deconstruction, stockpile settings
      n waypoints, unit routes, & notes
      w specify burrows: arbitrary areas
    status screens
      a announcements
      r reports
      z status: general status & inventories
          ALSO CONTROLS slaughtering, stone use
      u units list
      R rooms & buildings list
      l legendary artifacts
      c civilizations
    other control screens:
      j jobs: production queue
      n nobles: administrative memberships
      m military: squad memberships, uniforms, supplies
      s squad orders
      o standing orders: general fortress-wide behavior
      h hotkeys
  In summary:
    some stuff is fixed size, some adjustably sized, others are arbitrary zones.
      some things look adjustably sized but are really just abitrary zones
    each is viewable and controlable.

Dwarf Fortress has an unintuitive wall/floor/ceiling model:
  walls occupy entire cells, while each cell has an (undisplayed) upper "wall" part and lower "floor" part
  ceilings are the floors of the cells of the next layer up
  doorways occupy entire cells
