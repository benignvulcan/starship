Notes about the Reality Being Modeled

Human sizes:
  avg human
    1.5 to 1.8 meters tall, few (less than 1% ?) above 2 meters
    50 to 150 kg, 70 averge
      .07 m^3 average volume
    average walking clearance seems to be about .5 meters wide
    humans most closely match a voxel volume of proportions 1x1x4
      fitting best into a volume of proportions 1x1x3
  corridors
    2 meters high feels short, though it looks like about 99% of actual humans would fit
      2.5 meters = 8.2 feet, similar to typical house ceiling height
    would need to be at least about 1 meter wide to permit simple/quick passing
  wheelchairs - typical turning-in-place requires just over 1.5 meter diameter
  by extrapolation, people, robots, machines, often need about 7 times their volume to articulate within?

Human Speeds
   1.4 m/s   walking, typical
   2.5 m/s   walking, maximum
   4.5 m/s   running, 1 mile, "average" person
   5.9 m/s   1 hour marathon record
   6.2 m/s   sprinting 100 m, "average" person
  10.4 m/s   sprinting, Olympic record

  Walking speeds correlate with "value of time", see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_walking_speed
